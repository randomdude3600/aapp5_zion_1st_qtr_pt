Melody can cycle for 30 miles against the wind in the same amount of time
that it takes her to cycle 66 miles with the wind. If the speed of the wind
is `$3mph$`, what is Melody's speed when she cycles with the wind?

<br>

STEP 1: READ THE PROBLEM 

<br>

1. There are two distances given. One is 30 and the other is 66 miles.
2. There is no direct translation.
3. You are given the speed of the wind to determine the rates.
4. As per 12.2, the rates are `$x-3$` against the wind, and `$x+3$` with the wind.
5. The problem states the amount of time is the same.

<br>

STEP 2: FILL THE CHART

<br>

|Traveling|`$d$`(distance)|`$r$`(rate)|`$t$`(time)|
|--|--|--|--|
|Cycle against the wind|30|`$x-3$`|`$\frac{30}{x-3}$`|
|Cycle with the wind|66|`$x+3$`|`$\frac{66}{x+3}$`|

<br>
STEP 3: SET UP THE EQUATION
<br>

1. Use the two rational expressions for the time that you named in your chart in Step 2
2. The problem states a total time in the problem. It is 8 hours.
3. Set up your equation as `$1st$` rational expression `$+2nd$` rational expression = total time

<br>

`$\frac{30}{x-3}=\frac{66}{x+3}$`

<br>
STEP 4: SOLVE THE EQUATION 
<br>

`$x=8$`

<br>
STEP 5: ANSWER THE QUESTION ASKED
<br>

1. You have the solution to the equation, but it is not the
answer to the equation.
2. The value of `$x$` is 8, which is Melody's rate without the
influence of the wind .
3. The question asks for Melody's rate with the wind.
4. Substitute 8 for `$x$` into the equation in your chart for her 
rate `$with$` the wind.

<br>

`$x+3$`

`$8+3=11$`

<br>

Answer: Melody's speed with the wind was `$\boxed{11mph}$`
