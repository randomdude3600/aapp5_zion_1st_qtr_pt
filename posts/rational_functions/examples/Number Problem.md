`$f$` is a function defined by

<br>

`$f(x)=\begin{Bmatrix}2x+4|x\leq2\\2x-1|x\gt2\end{Bmatrix}$`

<br>

Find `$f(0)$`, `$f(2)$`, `$f(4)$`.

<br>

Solution

<br>

`$f(0)$` is found by substituting `$x$` by `$0$` in the formula.

`$f(x)=2x+4$` since 0 is less than 2.

`$f(0)=4$`

`$f(2)$` is found by substituting `$x$` by `$2$` in the formula.

`$f(2)=2^2+4=8$`

`$f(4)$` is found by substituting `$x$` by `$4$` in the formula.

`$f(x)=2x-1$` since `$4$` is greater than `$2$`

`$f(4)=(2)4-1=7$`
